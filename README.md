# EDA of Compositional Variables: A case study of particle‐size fractions in agricultural soils
Exploratory analysis of particle‐size fractions in agricultural soils

Compositional data are closed data, meaning that they sum up to a constant (e.g. 100 weight percent). Herein, we use soil mineral fractions (i.e. sand, silt and clay percent) as a case study. The objective is to provide an overview of the influence of these minerals on LIBS spectra acquired from a number of soil samples.
